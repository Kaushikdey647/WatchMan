HELLO THERE AND WELCOME TO THE PROJECT,

I know you might be very very eager to start working on the project, but..

There are some rules about this:

1. Please look up the issues and try to work on them priority wise
2. <fill in your rule here>
3. If a file has more than 200 lines of code, it is a BIG file, try and split it
4. Use proper docstrings for every class and every function.
  4.1. The format for function is
    '''
    <Summary>

    Parameters:
    <arg1> (<type>): <description>
    <arg2> (<type>): <description>
    <arg3> (<type>): <description>
    ...

    Returns:
    <type>: <description>
    '''

    this will later be visible in help(function)

5. But follow the following documentation conventions
  * Highlighted Comment
  ! Warning Comment
  ? In Doubt
  TODO: A Todo ofcourse


  BETTER DOCUMENTATION == LONGER CODE LIFE
